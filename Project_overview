we want to make a solver for shapes 2 based for given the platforms, blueprints and input shape.

focus on programmatic implementation of the following:
-research shapes 2 game play.
-research platform sizes.
-research blueprint codes.
-research shape codes.
-research blueprint codes.
-research shape functions 
-research floors.

we need a simulate a given design with an input shape and desired output shape/s each port on the foundation should be labeled input/outputs. on each level of the foundation as well.

i want to be able to specify an input shape/s and output shape/s and have the program evolve/design a solution using the basic shape operations and blueprint code.

i would like a graphical representation of the solutions currently being explored.

should be an evolutionary algorithm unless there is a better search function you can use.

put notes into joplin a new notebook called games -> shapes2 -> solver

For each programming function try to decouple as much as possible, that is the simulator should not depend on the method used to search solutions vis versa. 

I should be able to specify the canditate pool size.

Foundation used for canditate solutions should be selected from a radio select box selected by the user, same as the type of functions used.
